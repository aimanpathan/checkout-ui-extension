# Checkout UI Extension

* Created Order protection product module to be rendered after the shipping methods step
* This module adds a product and removes it if unchecked
* It has useState and useEffect react hooks used
* It has different Shopify ui extensions components used such as Checkbox, Banner, Text, View, etc
* I am also using the settings configurations to get the product ID dynamically from the customiser
